Fake_Job_Detection-NLP-project

Designed a classification model that uses text data features and meta-features and predict which job description are fraudulent or real.
In this project the task is to predict the fake job postings. There are 18 columns like title, department, company profile, job description etc. 
For this project I used NLP(Natural Language Processing) technique which analyse text data and build a prediction model for train the data.

There are 17880 samples in the dataset in which 17014 are real job data and 866 are fake job data. The model I built which shows 97.11 percent accuracy which is pretty much
good. But, It can be imporove as well to perform with more accuracy.

Tools Used:- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Spacy, Wordcloud and Sklearn.
